category: [ DNA, Methylation ]
tags: [ DNA, Stylophora, Methylation, pH, Shallow, Mesophotic ]
---

Samples for DNA methylation are from the pH experiment with shallow and mesophotic _Stylophora pistillata_ adults. The DNA was extracted by me with the [Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit), following the [protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/) of emmastrand (https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/).

For this Methyl-Binding Domain Enrichment I used the [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/MBD-Meth-Comp/) of meschedl with some adjustments.

### Shearing Samples to ~500bp

1. Prepare samples for 1µg in 80µl of Tris HCl, see [protocol](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/protocols/Tris%20HCL%2C%20RNA-DNA%20extraction.docx) Tris HCl 

|Sample|Volume DNA|Volume Tris HCl|
|S1|16.03|63.97|
|S2|18.25|61.75|
|S3|18.25|68.48|
|S4|36.9|43.1|
|S5|43.29|36.71|
|S6|58.82|21.18|

2. For shearing the samples, I used the [sonicator](https://www.mrclab.co.il/%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%90%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%A2-650-%D7%95%D7%95%D7%90%D7%98-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%98%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94) that they have in the biology department building.

   Note: with their sonicator you can do only one sample at a time. Each sample was in a 1.5 ml tube.
3. Set time for 1min 30 sec, 30 second on 30 seconds off, 20% amplitude
4. Check samples on tapestation after sonication


### MBD Enrichment

_Made 43000µl of 1X Wash/Bind buffer from 5X concentrate before starting_

**Preparing Beads**

1. Pipetted up and down the Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin to resuspend them

**Capture Reaction**

33. To 6 new 1.5mL tubes, added 20µl each of **5X** bind/wash buffer
34. To each appropriate tube, added the 80µl of the sheared DNA samples (above)
35. Transferred all of each diluted DNA sample to separate tubes with the MBD-Biotin bound beads for a total of 200µl in each tube and pipetted to mix
36. Mixed on rotisserie mixer overnight at 4 degrees C 

**Removing Non-Captured DNA**

38. Again started by writing out protocol to calculate how much 1X bind/wash buffer to dilute (25000µl needed and appropriately diluted)
39. Took tubes out of the cold room rotisserie and spun down **briefly**
40. Placed tubes on magnet rack for 1 minute
41. Removed clear supernatant and **SAVED** in tubes labeled non-captured DNA and sample number

56. Spun down tubes **briefly** and placed on magnet rack for 1 minute
57. Removed clear supernatant and **SAVED** in each sample tube for captured DNA, for a total of 400µl in each tube

**Ethanol Precipitation**

Each tube for ethanol precipitation gets 1µl of glycogen (co-precipitator), 1/10th the volume of the sample of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of the sample 100% ethanol:

|Sample|vol glycogen (µl)|vol sodium acetate (µl)| vol 100% EtOH (µl)|
|S1 Captured|1|40|800|
|S2 Captured|1|40|800|
|S3 Captured|1|40|800|

60. Set centrifuge to 1 degrees C  with about 15 min time left and let it run to get down to temp
61. Put 70% EtOH in -20 to chill down
62. Took sample tubes out of -80 and centrifuged for **15 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
63. Took tubes out of centrifuge **one at a time** to keep cold, looked at tubes to see if there was a pellet. The non-captured 1431 sample did not have a visible pellet. In all these steps tubes were taken out of the centrifuge one at a time to keep them cold
64. Removed the supernatant and discarded **very carefully**. All samples had a very very small visible pellet
65. Added 500µl of **cold** 70% EtOH to each tube carefully
66. Centrifuged for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C and 14,000 rcf
67. **Very carefully** removed supernatant from pellet
68. Centrifuged tubes for **5 minutes** at 1 degrees C at 14,000 rcf
69. Removed any remaining supernatant as best as possible with the smallest pipette tip and making sure to not removed the pellet
70. Air dried pellet for 3 minutes
71. Resuspended pellets in 25µl of ultra pure water
72. Check the DNA concentration with Nanodrop.
