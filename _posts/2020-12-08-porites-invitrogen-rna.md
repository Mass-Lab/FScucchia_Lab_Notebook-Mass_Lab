In this Extraction I used: [Invitrogen RNA mini kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/it/en/home/life-science/dna-rna-purification-analysis/rna-extraction/rna-types/total-rna-extraction/purelink-rna-mini-kit.html), [my Protocol](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/protocols/Coral%20fragment%20RNA%20extraction.docx), and the [company manual](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/company-manuals/purelink_rna_mini_kit_man.pdf) from page 27.

**Goal**: Extract high quality RNA for sequencing   

## Sample Preparation

1.	Add 550 uL trizol to a small frozen coral fragment in a 2 ml tube (if the sample is with RNA-safe, add equal volume of trizol)
2.	Put samples into a cell disruptor for < 2 minutes at 2000 rpm
3.	Transfer the liquid (~ 550 uL) into a new tube, add 450 uL trizol 
4.	Incubate 5 minutes at 15°-30° C
5.	Add 100 uL BCP (1–bromo–3–chloropropane)
6.	Vortex 15 seconds and incubate at 15°-30° C for 2-3 minutes
7.	Centrifuge at 12000g for 15 minutes (in the meantime, prepare PureLink® DNase following step 14)
8.	Transfer supernatant to a RNA-free tube and follow Invitrogen PureLink RNA Mini Kit (page 27 of the kit manual):
9.	Add equal volume (~ 0.6 ml) of 70% ethanol to the tissue homogenate
10.	Mix thoroughly by shaking or vortexing to disperse any visible precipitate that may form after adding ethanol 
11.	Transfer ≤700 μL of the sample (including any remaining precipitate) to the Spin Cartridge
12.	Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through, and reinsert the Spin Cartridge in the same Collection Tube
13.	Repeat Steps 11–12 until the entire sample is processed. If DNA-free total RNA is required, proceed to On-column PureLink® DNase Treatment Protocol (page 63)
14.	Prepare PureLink® DNase by adding the following components (supplied with PureLink® DNase) to a clean, RNase-free microcentrifuge tube. Prepare 80 μL per sample

| Component | Volume |
| 10X DNase I Reaction Buffer | 8ul |
| Resuspended DNase(3U/ul) | 10ul |
| RNase free water | 62ul |

15.	Add 350 μL Wash Buffer I to the Spin Cartridge containing the bound RNA. Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through and the Collection Tube. Place the Spin Cartridge into a new Collection Tube 
16.	Add 80 μL PureLink® DNase mixture (prepared as described above) directly onto the surface of the Spin Cartridge membrane 
17.	Incubate at room temperature for <15 minutes
18.	Add 350 μL Wash Buffer I to the Spin Cartridge. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard flow-through and the Collection Tube and insert the Spin Cartridge into a new Collection Tube
19.	Add 500 μL Wash Buffer II with ethanol (page 11) to the Spin Cartridge
20.	Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through, and reinsert the Spin Cartridge in the same Collection Tube 
21.	Repeat Steps 19-20 once 
22.	Centrifuge the Spin Cartridge at 12,000 × g for 1 minute at room temperature to dry the membrane with attached RNA. Discard the Collection Tube and insert the Spin Cartridge into a Recovery Tube 
23.	Add 100 μL RNase-Free Water to the center of the Spin Cartridge
24.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute 
25.	Centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥12,000 × g at room temperature
26.	Proceed to analyzing RNA Yield and Quality (Nanodrop and TapeStation)
