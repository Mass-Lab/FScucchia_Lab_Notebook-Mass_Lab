category: [ Extraction ]
tags: [ RNA, Stylophora, RNA Extraction, larvae, primary polyps ]

In this Extraction I used: [Invitrogen RNA micro kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/12183016?SID=srch-srp-12183016#/12183016?SID=srch-srp-12183016), [my Protocol](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/protocols/Coral%20fragment%20RNA%20extraction.docx), and the [company manual](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/company-manuals/purelink_rna_micro_kit_man.pdf) from page 19.

**Goal**: Extract high quality RNA for sequencing.   

## Sample Preparation

1. Add 550 uL trizol to the larvae/primary polyps in a 2 ml tube and homogenize
2.	Put homogenized (550 uL) into a qiashredder column and centrifuge for 1 minute (12000g)
3.   Add 450 uL trizol to the collection tube
4.	Incubate 5 minutes at 15°-30° C
5.	Add 100 uL BCP (1–bromo–3–chloropropane)
6.	Vortex 15 seconds and incubate at 15°-30° C for 2-3 minutes
7.	Centrifuge at 12000g for 15 minutes (in the meantime, prepare PureLink® DNase following step 14)
8.	Transfer supernatant to a RNA-free tube and follow Invitrogen PureLink RNA Micro Kit (page 19 of the kit manual):
9.	Add equal volume (~ 0.6 ml) of 70% ethanol to the tissue homogenate
10.	Mix thoroughly by shaking or vortexing to disperse any visible precipitate that may form after adding ethanol
11.	Transfer ≤700 μL of the sample (including any remaining precipitate) to the Spin Cartridge
12.	Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through, and reinsert the Spin Cartridge in the same Collection Tube
13.	Repeat Steps 11–12 until the entire sample is processed
14.	Prepare PureLink® DNase by adding the following components (supplied with PureLink® DNase) to a clean, RNase-free microcentrifuge tube. Prepare 20 μL per sample

| Component | Volume |
| 2X DNase Reaction Buffer | 10ul |
| Resuspended DNase | 10ul |

15.	Add 350 μL Wash Buffer I to the Spin Cartridge containing the bound RNA. Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through and the Collection Tube. Place the Spin Cartridge into a new Collection Tube
16.	Add 20 μL PureLink® DNase mixture (prepared as described above) directly onto the surface of the Spin Cartridge membrane
17.	Incubate at room temperature for <15 minutes
18.	Add 350 μL Wash Buffer I to the Spin Cartridge. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard flow-through and the Collection Tube and insert the Spin Cartridge into a new Collection Tube
19.	Add 500 μL Wash Buffer II with ethanol to the Spin Cartridge
20.	Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 seconds at room temperature. Discard the flow-through, and reinsert the Spin Cartridge in the same Collection Tube
21.	Repeat Steps 19-20 once
22.	Centrifuge the Spin Cartridge at 12,000 × g for 1 minute at room temperature to dry the membrane with attached RNA. Discard the Collection Tube and insert the Spin Cartridge into a Recovery Tube
23.	Add 12-22 μL RNase-Free Water to the center of the Spin Cartridge
24.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
25.	Centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥12,000 × g at room temperature
26.	Proceed to analyzing RNA Yield and Quality (Nanodrop and TapeStation)
