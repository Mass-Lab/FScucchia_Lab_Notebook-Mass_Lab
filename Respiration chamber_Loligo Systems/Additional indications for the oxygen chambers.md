# Additional indications for the oxygen chambers

Follow the instructions of the [Quick guide for microplate respirometry system](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/Respiration%20chamber_Loligo%20Systems/Quick%20guide%20for%20microplate%20respirometry%20system.pdf)

-	Make sure that the wells are properly sealed before starting the run.
-	Manual calibration: once you have reached step 14d of the quick guide, click Start log and let the measurements run for a few seconds, then click Stop logging. 
    This way you will create and save in your computer an excel file with only the calibration values.
-	Before measuring the respiration rate of your samples, incubate them in the dark for 20-30 minutes. After incubation, start the logging and let it run for around 1 
    hour (you can let it run for more if needed).
-	After stopping the run with your samples, open right away the resulting excel file with the raw data in the Analysis mode of the software, and save the new excel 
    file with the results (you will not be able to do use the Analysis mode from home, since you need the USB key to do it).

Look at the [Experiment Setting](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/Respiration%20chamber_Loligo%20Systems/Experiment%20setting%20.png), [Selection of wells and treatments](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/Respiration%20chamber_Loligo%20Systems/selections%20of%20wells%20and%20treatments%20.png), and [Analysis mode](https://github.com/fscucchia/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Mass_Lab/blob/master/Respiration%20chamber_Loligo%20Systems/Analysis%20mode%20.png) to see the input parameters of the MicroResp software.
